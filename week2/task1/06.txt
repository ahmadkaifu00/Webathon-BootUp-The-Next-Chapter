Que-6:	What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?

Ans: var: The scope of var is limited to the function where it is declared and can be re-declare and re-assign.
Example:
var x = 10;
var x = 20;
x = 30;

let: The scope of let is limited to the block where it is declared and can be re-assign but can't re-declare.
Example:
let y = 10;
y = 20;

const: The scope of const is limited to the block where it is declared and can't be re-declare and re-assign.
Example:
const z = 50;
